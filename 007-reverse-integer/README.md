# Reverse Integer

**Status:** Solved  
**Difficulty:** Medium

---

## Problem Statement
Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1], then return `0`.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```plaintext
x = 123
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
321
```

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```plaintext
x = -123
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
-321
```

### Example 3:
**Input:**
```plaintext
x = 120
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
21
```
