Palindrome Number
Status: Solved
Difficulty: Easy

Problem Statement
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

A palindrome number is a number that reads the same from left to right and right to left.

Examples
Example 1:
Input:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
x = 121
Output:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
True
Explanation:
121 reads the same forward and backward.

Example 2:
Input:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
x = -121
Output:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
False
Explanation:
From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-, which is not a valid number.
